I picked up a number of Confrontation miniatures back in the early 2000's when I was beginning to get into miniature painting. I loved the sculpts but new my paint jobs wouldn't do them justice at the time. The Griffin Inquisitor was the first one I tried painting once I built up enough confidence to try and give them a shot.

He was originally painted as an undead hunter for our Witchfire Trilogy game that used the Children of the Sun rules. I didn't trust my NMM skills enough to give it a go on this one, so I opted for two-toned metals instead.
